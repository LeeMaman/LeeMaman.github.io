Hey everybody! <br />
  I just want to take the time to thank you in advance for supporting my music and getting involved with the new album! This is a very special project for me, and by far, the most exciting! <br />
  Please jump on board and be part of my team with just three simple clicks! And when you arrive at my Kickstarter page, you can take it even further by pledging!<br>
  THANKS!
